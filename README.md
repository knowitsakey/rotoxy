This is a proxy server using multiple instances of tor in order to increase bandwidth for operatings using the tor network.
Traffic is routed through a hidden service such that outgoing and incoming traffic appears to be coming from the remote ip address, giving an adversary a harder time who attempts to trace malicious behavior using netflow correlation.
Some internet backbone-level government surveillance relies on netflow correlation to identify malicious actors using anonymity tools to hide or nonrepudiate their actions.
This is a deeply charged, political topic. The purpose of this project was to advance the state of the art of netflow correlation on the tor network, in the interest of preventing cyberattacks originating from hostile countries.
